The *cloudmesh-job* provides a job queuing and scheduling framework. It 
includes a library as well as a commandline interface. Both
allow users to leverage all the available compute resources to 
perform tasks which have heavy usage of compute power and high execution 
time. A user can configure all available compute resources as 'hosts' in a 
configuration file along with the list of jobs to be executed. Then, based 
on the scheduler policy, user can schedule these jobs on configured hosts.

## Example

An additional example is documented in

[Example](README-example.md)


## Prerequisites

* Cloudmesh-job uses `ssh` access to the remote compute machine. ssh clients are avalaible on all major platforms including macOS, Linux, Windows.
* It is assumed that you use public keys to authenticate to remote machines. We assume you use ssh-add and/or keychain to avoid issuing passwords when you use the cloudmehs-job
* We do not recommend using passwordless keys as ssh-add and keychain exist to avoid this.
 

## Installation

We assume you have a venv such as ~/ENV in which you have python 3.8 or python 3.9

```bash
(ENV) $ mkdir cm
(ENV) $ cd cm
(ENV) $ pip install cloudmesh-installer
(ENV) $ cloudmesh-installer install job
(ENV) $ cd cloudmesh-job
```


## Configuration

On Windows machines, using `gitbash` to run these commands is advised if a 
Linux like terminal is preferred by users.

The current jobset filename is stored in the cloudmesh variables under the 
variable `jobset`. It can be queried with

```cms set jobset```

It can be set with

```cms set jobset=VALUE```

An example is

```bash
$ cms set jobset
set jobset
jobset='~/.cloudmesh/job/spec.yaml'
```

The content of the jobset can be created using

```cms job template```

This template configuration will then have the following content:

```yaml
cloudmesh:
  default:
    user: username
  jobset:
    hosts:
      localhost:
        name: localhost
        ip: localhost
        cpu_count: '2'
        status: free
        job_counter: '2'
        max_jobs_allowed: '1'
      juliet:
        name: juliet
        ip: juliet.futuresystems.org
        cpu_count: '12'
        status: free
        job_counter: '0'
        max_jobs_allowed: '4'
    scheduler:
      policy: smart
    jobs:
      ls_j:
        name: ls_j
        directory: .
        ip: juliet.futuresystems.org
        input: ./data
        output: ./output/ls_j
        status: ready
        gpu: ' '
        user: username
        arguments: ' '
        executable: 'python test.py'
        shell: bash
        submitted_to_ip: juliet.futuresystems.org
```  

## Available methods
 
### Hosts

To configure available compute resources as 'hosts' in the configuration
file you can use the following command, that will add this new host in the
jobset configuration file.  
To list the hosts we have a convenient list command.

```bash
cms job hosts add --hostname=name --ip=ip --cpu_count=n --max_jobs_allowed=x
    Adds a host in jobset yaml file.

cms job list hosts
    Enlists all the hosts configured in jobset
```

### Scheduler

One can configure and inquire scheduler a policy
that is used by the `cms job run` command to schedule and 
execute jobs. The following scheduler policies are available:

* sequential - Use first available host
* random     - Use random available host
* smart      - Use a host with highest availability
* frugal     - Use a host with least availability

To confugure or inquire a scheduler, use the following commands:

```bash
cms job scheduler --policy=random
    Assigns policy name to the scheduler policy

cms job scheduler info
    Shows currently configured scheduler policy
```

### Jobs

To schedule, modify and inquire the jobs, please use the following commands:

```bash
cms job info
    Prints location of job queue file.

cms job set '~/.cloudmesh/job/spec.yaml'
    Sets jobset as the FILE provided. Further process refers jobset.

cms job template a.yaml --name="b[0-1]"; less a.yaml
    Creates the jobs b0 and b1 as templates in the jobset.

cms job add --name=z[0-1] --ip=123,345 --executable='ls'
            --input='../data' --output='a,b'
    Creates entries in jobset for jobs z0 and z1 with provided
    arguments.

cms job add '~/.cloudmesh/another.yaml'
    Adds jobs from FILE to jobset

cms job list
    Enlist all jobs

cms job list --name='perform'
    Enlist all jobs with the phrase 'perform' in job name

cms job list --status='ready'
    Enlist all jobs in status 'ready'

cms job status
    Enlists all jobs ordered by their status

cms job reset --name=NAME
    Resets the status of the job to 'ready'.

cms job run --name=ls_j
    Submits job(s) to host decided by the scheduler policy

cms job kill --name=ls_j
    Kills the job

cms job delete --name=ls_j
    Deletes a job from the jobset. If job is in 'submitted'
    status then it is killed first and then deleted from jobset.
```

      name[01-04] which would kill all jobs with the given names

    job run [--name=NAME]
      Run all jobs from jobset. If --name argument is provided then
      run a specific job

    job hosts add --hostname=name --ip=ip --cpu_count=n
                 .--max_jobs_allowed=x
      Adds a host in jobset yaml file.

    job list hosts

    job scheduler --policy=random
      Assigns policy name to the scheduler policy

    job scheduler info
      Shows currently configured scheduler policy

    job help
      prints the manual page

Job States:

   done   - job completed
   ready  - ready for scheduling
   failed - job failed
   timeout - timeout
   submitted - job submitted to remote machine for execution

Scheduler policies:

   sequential - Use first available host
   random     - Use random available host
   smart      - Use a host with highest availability
   frugal     - Use a host with least availability

Job specification:

   The jobs are specified in 'spec.yaml' file

   name:
     ip: ip of the host
     input: where the input comes form (locally to ip)
     output: where to store the outout (locally to ip)
     status: the status
     gpu: the GPU specification # string such as "0,2" as defined by
          the GPU framework e.g. NVIDIA
     user: the userneme on ip to execute the job
     directory: the working directory
     arguments: the arguments passed along # lis of key values
     executable: the executable
     shell: bash # executes the job in the provided shell
            $(SHELL) will use the default user shell

    The current jobset filename is stored in the cloudmesh variables
    under the variable "jobset". It can be queried with cms set
    jobset. It can be set with

      cms set jobset=VALUE

    We may not even do cms job set VALUE due to this simpler existing
    way of interfacing we can query the variables with

        variables = Variables()

    and also set them that way

      variables["jobset"] = VALUE.

Usage examples:
  cms job info
      Prints location of job queue file.

  cms job set '~/.cloudmesh/job/spec.yaml'
      Sets jobset as the FILE provided. Further process refers jobset.

  cms job template --name="b[0-1]"; less a.yaml
      Creates the jobs b0 and b1 as templates in the jobset.

  cms job add --name=z[0-1] --ip=123,345 --executable='ls'
             .--input='..\data' --output='a,b'
      Creates entries in jobset for jobs z0 and z1 with provided
      arguments.

  cms job add '~/.cloudmesh/another.yaml'
      Adds jobs from FILE to jobset

  cms job list
      Enlist all jobs

  cms job list --name='perform'
      Enlist all jobs with the phrase 'perform' in job name

  cms job list --status='ready'
      Enlist all jobs in status 'ready'

                   .--max_jobs_allowed=x
      Adds a host in jobset yaml file.

  cms job list hosts
      Enlists all the hosts configured in jobset

  cms job scheduler --policy=random
      Assigns policy name to the scheduler policy

## Tests

We provide two simple pytets that you can customize by setting the host and the
user. The first test checks the usage of the commandline, the second, the
usage of the API.

```bash
$ cms set host='juliet.futuresystems.org'
$ cms set user=$USER

$ pytest -v --capture=no tests/test_01_job_cli.py
$ pytest -v --capture=no tests/test_02_job_api.py
```

## API of `cms job` command
An API is created using FastAPI. This API allows users to interact with the 
cloudmesh-job module via a user-friendly interface.

Use following command to start the FastAPI server on localhost:
```bash
(ENV3) $ cms job --service start
```

To launch the API from command line, use following command:
```bash
(ENV3) $ cms job --service info
```
This launches the cloudmesh-job API in a browser. The UI is based on OpenAPI:
![cloudmesh-job API](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-job/blob/main/tests/sample_scripts/sample_outputs/API_doc.png)

Documentation of the API is available as below:
